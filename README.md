# Teambox Middleware Daemon

This software was designed to talk to http://github.com/tmbx/tbxsosd. It's a small daemon which receives commands on socket or standard input. This is not to be used by third party.

If you need to use any of the features of the tbxsosd, you should consider using its protocol directly.
